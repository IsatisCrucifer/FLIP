# FLIP the game #

This game is my first mid-scale Unity project, and is a practice project when I was learning Unity at lccnet.

The core mechanic of this game is inspired by the esoteric language "Flip", created by Rune Zedeler and Erik Søe Sørensen.
Their original page for this language is dead, but a backup can still be accessed from [Wayback Machine][1].

For puzzle making purposes, there are a number of places that is different from the original "Flip" language.
